# Second lecture Demo

This is a project for the second lecture (Node JS basics)

It includes your home task.

Add `.gitignore` file and follow the TODOs inside the files.

Use `.gitignore` file to exclude a file from the repo (node_modules, IDE configurations, .pdf, .txt)

Add one big (e.g. pdf) file and not so big file (.txt) to a data folder.
Use these files for functions in `.js` files.
